				+ "  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\n"
				+ "  publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n"
				+ "  Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\n" + "\n"
				+ "  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n"
				+ "  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n"
				+ "  license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n"
				+ "  import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n"
				+ "  if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall\n"
				+ "  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\n"
				+ "  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\n"
				+ "  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n"
				+ "  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n"
				+ "  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n" + "  licensed hereunder.\n"
				+ "\n" + "  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n"
				+ "  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n"
				+ "  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n"

				+ "  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n"
				+ "  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n" + "\n"
				+ "  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\n"
				+ "  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\n"

				+ "3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n" + "\n"
				+ "  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n"
				+ "  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n"
				+ "  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n"
				+ "  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n"
				+ "  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n"
				+ "  used for software exchange; and\n" + "\n"
				+ "  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n"
				+ "  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n"
				+ "     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n"
				+ "     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n"
				+ "     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n"
				+ "     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n"
				+ "     for a particular purpose;\n" + "\n"
				+ "     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n"
				+ "     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n"
				+ "     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n" + "\n"
				+ "     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n"
				+ "     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n" + "\n"
				+ "     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n"
				+ "     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n" + "     of this section 3.\n"
				+ "\n" + "3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n" + "\n"
				+ "  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n"
				+ "  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n"
				+ "  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n"
				+ "  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n"
				+ "  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n"
				+ "  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n" + "\n"
				+ "  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n" + "  the Program.\n" + "\n"
				+ "3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\n"
				+ "trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\n"
				+ "of liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\n"
				+ "the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\n"
				+ "their own appropriate notices.\n" + "\n" + "4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n" + "\n"
				+ "Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\n"
				+ "with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\n"
				+ "license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\n"
				+ "the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\n"
				+ "offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\n"
				+ "liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\n"
				+ "the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n"
				+ "(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\n"
				+ "other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\n"
				+ "damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\n"
				+ "and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\n"
				+ "Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\n"
				+ "Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\n"
				+ "in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\n"
				+ "apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\n"
				+ "intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\n"
				+ "Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\n"
				+ "writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\n"
				+ "and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\n"
				+ "related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\n"
				+ "participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n" + "\n"
				+ "For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\n"
				+ "product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\n"
				+ "Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\n"
				+ "claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\n"
				+ "claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\n"
				+ "alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\n"
				+ "defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\n"
				+ "claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\n"
				+ "pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\n" + "those damages.\n" + "\n"
				+ "5. NO WARRANTY\n" + "\n" + "EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\n"
				+ "PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\n"
				+ "BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n"
				+ "IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\n"
				+ "TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n"
				+ "PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\n"
				+ "appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\n"
				+ "risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\n"
				+ "including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\n"
				+ "compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\n"
				+ "or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n" + "\n"
				+ "6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n" + "\n"
				+ "EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\n"
				+ "PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\n"
				+ "SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\n"
				+ "EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\n"
				+ "PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\n"
				+ "CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\n"
				+ "ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\n"
				+ "EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\n"
				+ "POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n" + "\n" + "7. GENERAL\n" + "\n"
				+ "If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n"
				+ "applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n"
				+ "the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\n"
				+ "action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\n"
				+ "minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n" + "\n"
				+ "If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n"
				+ "(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\n"
				+ "Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\n"
				+ "or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\n"
				+ "rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\n" + "litigation is filed.\n"
				+ "\n" + "All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\n"
				+ "fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\n"
				+ "Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\n"
				+ "time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\n"
				+ "rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\n"
				+ "and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\n"
				+ "However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\n"
				+ "granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n" + "\n"
				+ "Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\n"
				+ "but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\n"
				+ "may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\n"
				+ "reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\n"
				+ "this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\n"
				+ "Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\n"
				+ "is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\n"
				+ "responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\n"
				+ "entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\n"
				+ "version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\n"
				+ "Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\n"
				+ "received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\n"
				+ "Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\n"
				+ "Contributions) under the new version.\n" + "\n"
				+ "Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\n"
				+ "receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\n"
				+ "Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\n"
				+ "estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\n"
				+ "under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended\n"
				+ "to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.\n"
				+ "No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\n" + "\n"
